Pry#retrieve_line:
- ! 'This method is much too long and complicated.

  I have no idea how it got to be like this but it''s terrifying, somebody fix it,
  please. Kyrylo?

'
Pry#binding_stack:
- ! 'Should binding_stack be turned into a fully-fledged object? Keeping it as an
  array seems a bit low-level somehow..

'
gist:
- ! "currently gisting (as well as 'play' and a few other commands) is too complicated,
  we must remember -m, -c, -i, -k and so on.Instead, if those commands could act similarly
  to `show-source` and infer the object type \nfrom the 'name' of the object it would
  make things a lot more streamlined.\n\nHowever, although we have ways of identifying
  and disambiguating between methods and classes and commands, and potentially file
  names, we don't have any syntax for specifying input expressions, output expressions,
  \nor history. Do we need syntax for these ? are they rare enough not to bother optimising?\n\nPrecedence
  for names \n* classes/modules (e.g Pry::Code)\n* methods (e.g Pry#run_command)\n*
  commands (e.g show-source)\n* files  (e.g alpha.rb)\n\nExplicit flags (do these
  need their own syntax to avoid flags?)\n-i input expressions\n-o output expressions\n--hist
  history\n\n"
